I have been programming for 7 years, and know many languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, C#, HTML, CSS. I am interested in Mechanical Design, Hardware, and Programming, specifically in systems that integrate the three, such as Robotics. I am currently focused on gaining more experience in these areas, and have been taking on jobs and projects which reflect that.</description></item></channel></rss>
