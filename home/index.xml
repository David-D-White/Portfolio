I am experienced in Mechanical and Electrical design with a little over 3 years experience in each. I have used tools such as Altium, Eagle, Fusion360, Solidworks, and many others over those 3 years. I am experienced in the full prototyping process, from design to assembly and testing. I also have 9 years of programming experience, and have experience using low level languages such as C, C++, and 8086 Assembly as well as high level languages such as Java and Python as well as everything in between.</description></item></channel></rss>
