<source src=/portfolio/video/rover.mp4 type=video/mp4></video></center><h1 id=about-the-project>About the Project</h1><p>As an assignment in preperation for 4th year design projects, I created an all-terain autonomous rover with 4 of my friends over the course of a month. The rover is designed to accurately and autonomously navigate an obstacle course containing sandy and rocky terrain, as well as pit traps. The rover is equipped to assess it&rsquo;s position and orientation within the course, and make adjustments accordingly.</p><p>The robot was designed around an Arduino Uno, which was programmed in C and handles the sensor input, processing, and control. The robot uses 2 Time of Flight sensors which read distances to the walls of the course, and an IMU which measures angular velocity and linear acceleration to determine the robots orientation and track it&rsquo;s movement through the course. Fusing the data from each of these sensors provides real time tracking of the robots absolute position within the course. The robot is equipped with custom 3D-Printed compliant wheels which feature large notches to help the robot traverse large ledges on the course. The rover features a dual motor gearbox controlled by the microcontroller using an H-bridge IC, and timing belts to couple the rotation of the front and back wheels. This provides the rover with 4WD and tank-like steering, allowing it to turn in place and navigate rough terain more easily.</p><p>Throughout this project I was primarily responsible for the mechaical design, including the design of the compliant wheels, as well as sharing responsibility for the navigation code. I also shared responsibility for the overall system design, including sensor selection and high level electrical design.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=entry-header><div class=entry-meta><span class=posted-on><time class="entry-date published" datetime="April 48, 272712">April 27, 2021</time></span></div><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://david-d-white.github.io/portfolio/projects/down-dog/ rel=bookmark>Ludum Dare 48 - "Down Dog"</a></h1></header><div class=entry-content><h1 id=project-in-action>Project in Action</h1><center><video width=100% controls muted autoplay loop>

In this game you descend through a dungeon level with 2 different enemy types, special obstacles, and fight a boss at the end. Since the game is fairly short, a timer is included for those who decide to speedrun the game.</p><p>This game was created in the <strong>Godot Engine</strong>, with all art, sound, and programming being completed within the span of the game jam. The game jam spanned 72 hours, of which I spent 24 moving back from my co-op job. Regardless of the extra difficulty this added, my friend and I were both proud of the result and will be doing more game jams in the future.</p><h3 id=play-down-doghttpsgamejoltcomgamesdowndog610823><strong><a href=https://gamejolt.com/games/DownDog/610823>Play Down Dog</a></strong></h3><h3 id=ludum-dare-pagehttpsldjamcomeventsludum-dare48down-dog><strong><a href=https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/down-dog>Ludum Dare Page</a></strong></h3><h3 id=project-on-githubhttpsgithubcomdavid-d-whitedown-dog><strong><a href=https://github.com/David-D-White/Down-Dog>Project on Github</a></strong></h3></div></article><article class=post><header class=entry-header><div class=entry-meta><span class=posted-on><time class="entry-date published" datetime="February 28, 202012">February 20, 2020</time></span></div><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://david-d-white.github.io/portfolio/projects/emulator-v1/ rel=bookmark>Handheld Console Emulator</a></h1></header><div class=entry-content><h1 id=project-in-action>Project in Action</h1><center><video width=100% controls muted autoplay loop>
<source src=/portfolio/video/emulator.mp4 type=video/mp4></video></center><h1 id=about-the-project>About the Project</h1><p>As an introduction to <strong>Schematic Capture</strong>, <strong>PCB Design</strong>, and <strong>Circuit Design</strong>, I decided to build a custom handheld emulator based around the <strong>Raspberry PI</strong>. For this project, I wanted to create a handheld emulator capable of emulating consoles from the PS1 era and before. I wanted to include analog joysticks for input, a reusable battery and charging circuit, as well as a touch screen for use with Nintendo DS emulation.</p><p>The project uses <strong>Emulation Station</strong> on the <strong>Raspberry PI</strong>, <strong>SPI</strong> for analog to digital conversion, includes a LiPo battery and <strong>charging circuit</strong>, and has a headphone jack and micro USB charging port. Analog to digital conversion, input was done in <strong>C++</strong> using the <strong>WiringPi</strong> library and linux <strong>libevdev</strong> to convert the GPIO inputs into OS readable input events.</p><p>The entire project, including circuit design, PCB design, mechanical design, programming, and assembly was done over the course of 2 months. The project even includes a custom <strong>3D printed</strong> enclosure with custom buttons.</p><p>This project is one of my favourite projects to date, and I have plans to create an improved version based around the Raspberry Pi CM4, making it thinner and adding new features.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=entry-header><div class=entry-meta><span class=posted-on><time class="entry-date published" datetime="December 128, 50512">December 5, 2018</time></span></div><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://david-d-white.github.io/portfolio/projects/chess-robot/ rel=bookmark>Autonomous Chess Playing robot</a></h1></header><div class=entry-content><h1 id=project-in-action>Project in Action</h1><center><video width=50% controls muted autoplay loop>
<source src=/portfolio/video/lego-robot.mp4 type=video/mp4></video></center><h1 id=about-the-project>About the Project</h1><p>As a first year project, I created a chess playing robot with two of my friends over the course of a month. The robot can accurately navigate the board, pick up pieces, and perform any legal chess move (including castling and en-passant). The robot can asses the current state of the board, make an informed decision, and execute a chosen move <strong>autonomously</strong>.</p><p>The robot was designed using the LEGO NXT robotics kit, and used custom laser cut gears and tracks in the assembly. The movement and control of the NXT robot was programmed in RobotC, communicating with an external phone via <strong>bluetooth</strong> to handle the <strong>computer vision</strong> and decision making. The phone app used to control the robot was programmed in <strong>Java</strong> and compiled using <strong>Android Studio</strong>. The app used <strong>OpenCV</strong> to determine the board state using special colour combinations painted on each piece. The board state was then passed into a <strong>custom neural network</strong> trained to choose the best move from a list of possible moves. This move was then converted to a unique string command, and sent to the NXT via bluetooth, after which the command would be parsed, and the move executed.</p><p>During this project, I designed the custom neural network, designed and laser cut the custom gears and gear tracks, designed the claw mechanism and carriage, programmed the movements, and aided in other parts of the design when needed.</p></div></article><article class=post><header class=entry-header><div class=entry-meta><span class=posted-on><time class="entry-date published" datetime="December 128, 50512">December 5, 2017</time></span></div><h1 class=entry-title><a href=https://david-d-white.github.io/portfolio/projects/make-it-home/ rel=bookmark>Ludum Dare 40 - "Make It Home"</a></h1></header><div class=entry-content><h1 id=project-in-action>Project in Action</h1><center><video width=100% controls muted autoplay loop>

This project was written entirely in <strong>Java</strong> without the use of any 3rd party libraries whatsoever.</p><p>The project is heavily inspired by old top-down pokemon games, and uses a math based combat system to teach basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p><p>For this project, I had to implement a custom tile based world, and tile based rendering engine, as well as custom asset management, input handlers, and audio handlers. This was one of the most intensive projects I completed in high school, but is still one of my favourites.</p><h3 id=project-on-githubhttpsgithubcomdavid-d-whiteterrarithmetic><strong><a href=https://github.com/David-D-White/Terrarithmetic>Project on Github</a></strong></h3></div></article></div></div><center class><ul class=pagination></ul></center></div></main><footer id=footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-md-3 widget"><h3 class=widget-title>Contact</h3><div class=widget-body><p><a href=mailto:david.daniel.white@gmail.com>david.daniel.white@gmail.com</a><br><br></p></div></div><div class="col-md-3 widget"><h3 class=widget-title>Follow me</h3><div class=widget-body><p class=follow-me-icons><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-d-white/ target=_blank><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-1x"></i></a>
