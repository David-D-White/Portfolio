### About Me
I am a 3rd year **Mechatronics Engineering** student at the University of Waterloo. I have been **programming for 7 years**, and know many languages such as **C**, **C++**, **Python**, **Java**, **C#**, **HTML**, **CSS**. I also have **2 years of circuit design** experience, with tools such as Altium, Eagle, and Fusion360 Electrical. I am interested in **Mechanical Design**, **Hardware**, and **Programming**, specifically in systems that integrate the three, such as **Robotics**. I am currently focused on gaining more experience in these areas, and have been taking on jobs and projects which reflect that.

I enjoy a variety of sports such as rock climbing, skiing, surfing, and enjoy playing the drums to unwind. I am passionate about the work I do, and always strive to further my own abilities and produce the best results possible.
