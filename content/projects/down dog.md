# About the Project
For the Ludum Dare 48 game jam, I created a pixel art platformer with one of my oldest friends. In this game you descend through a dungeon level with 2 different enemy types, special obstacles, and fight a boss at the end. Since the game is fairly short, a timer is included for those who decide to speedrun the game.

This game was created in the **Godot Engine**, with all art, sound, and programming being completed within the span of the game jam. The game jam spanned 72 hours, of which I spent 24 moving back from my co-op job. Regardless of the extra difficulty this added, my friend and I were both proud of the result and will be doing more game jams in the future.
