# About the Project
For the ludum dare 40 game jam, I created a low-poly 3D driving game my best friend from high school. In the game you must dodge the obstacles scattered about the road, but the twist is that the game will apply several disorienting effects to make the driving experience more difficult.

This game was created in the **Unity Engine** using **C#**, with all art, sound, and programming being completed within the span of the 72 hour game jam. This was my first game jam ever, and is an unforgettable high school experience for me. This experience inspired me to complete the __[ludum dare 48 game jam](projects/down-dog)__ with another friend.
