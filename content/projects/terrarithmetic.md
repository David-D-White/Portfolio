# About the Project
Terrarithmetic is an math teaching game I created with a friend in grade 10 as a cumulative project. This project was written entirely in **Java** without the use of any 3rd party libraries whatsoever.

The project is heavily inspired by old top-down pokemon games, and uses a math based combat system to teach basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

For this project, I had to implement a custom tile based world, and tile based rendering engine, as well as custom asset management, input handlers, and audio handlers. This was one of the most intensive projects I completed in high school, but is still one of my favourites.
